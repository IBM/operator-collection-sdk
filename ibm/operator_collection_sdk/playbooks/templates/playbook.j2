  # Operator Collection's target hosts are driven using z/OS Endpoints provided by the IBM z/OS Cloud Broker.
  # For this reason, the playbook MUST use the "hosts: all" parameter
  # When the Ansible Playbook is executed by the IBM z/OS Cloud Broker, the hosts: all value is limited to the selected z/OS Endpoint by setting the --limit flag. 
  # This is done internally by the IBM z/OS Cloud Broker and no additional playbook modifications must be made to handle host limiting.
