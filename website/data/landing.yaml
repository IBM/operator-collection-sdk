  title: "IBM Operator Collection SDK"
  subtitle: "The IBM Operator Collection SDK is used to assist in the end-to-end deployment of your Ansible Collections during the development lifecycle. \n\n Operator Collections are simply [Ansible Collections](https://www.ansible.com/blog/getting-started-with-ansible-collections) that are dynamically converted to [Ansible Operators](https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-operator) in Openshift when imported via the [IBM® z/OS® Cloud Broker](https://ibm.biz/ibm-zoscb-install). This allows you to write any [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html), develop and iterate on it locally, publish to Openshift, and expose a catalog of statefully managed, new services."
